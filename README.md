# Link to Deployed React App:


# Instructinos on How to Locally Run the Application:
1. First, make sure that you install all necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root project directory.
2. Then, in this root project directory, you can run the command `npm start` to run the app in development mode.
3. The app should then automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser

(Note: In order to see changes reflected in the app running on localhost, just refresh the page. You may also see any lint errors in the console)
